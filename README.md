# Acoustic Source Localization - Honours Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of my honours project on acoustic source localization. Acoustic source localization is the process of determining the location of sound sources in a given environment using audio signals. This project explores various techniques and algorithms for accurately localizing sound sources in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

## Contents
- **src/**: This directory contains the source code for the acoustic source localization algorithms implemented in Python.
- **data/**: This directory contains sample audio recordings used for testing and evaluation purposes.
- **docs/**: This directory contains documentation, including project reports and presentations.
- **LICENSE**: The license file specifying the terms of use for this project.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
