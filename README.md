# Acoustic Source Localization - Honours Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of my honours project on acoustic source localization. Acoustic source localization is the process of determining the location of sound sources in a given environment using audio signals. This project explores various techniques and algorithms for accurately localizing sound sources in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

## Contents
- **Conventional_FFT/**: This directory contains the code for the  conventional-FFT acoustic source localization algorithms implemented in MATLAB.
- **MUSIC_algo/**: This directory contains MUSIC algorithm used for acoustic source localization.
- **Presentations/**: This directory contains documentation, including project reports and presentations.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:architiiit/Acoustic-Source-Localization.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Acoustic-Source-Localization

3. Run the codes present in different folders to understand the implementation and functionality of different algorithms.
4. Refer to the documentation in the `Presentations/` directory for detailed explanations, project reports, and presentations.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
